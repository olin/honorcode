# Honor Code

As a member of the Olin College community, I will strive to embody the spirit of honor and integrity as defined by the five core personal values and will take action to address any breach of that spirit.

**Integrity:** I will represent myself accurately and completely in my work, my words, and my actions in academic and
in non-academic affairs.

**Respect for Others:** I will be patient with and understanding of fellow community members, and considerate of their inherent dignity and personal property. I will care for community resources and facilities so others may effectively use them.

**Passion for the Welfare of the College:** I will be a steward for the welfare of Olin College through a spirit of cooperation, concern for others, and responsibility for the reputation of Olin College.

**Openness to Change:** I will be receptive to change, supportive of innovation, and willing to take risks for the benefit of the community.

**Do Something:** I will strive to better myself and my community and take responsibility for my own behavior. When I become aware of a violation of the Honor Code or an issue within the community, I will take action towards resolution of the situation. I expect others to do the same.
